I've been writing on [medium](https://medium.com/@zanwar.shubham) and dev.to for a while now. While they're great websites, I want to maintain the things I write, my projects and just any general information about me in a single place.

Of course, I will continue to contribute to more posts on the external websites - but the focus will now be shifted to creating good content on this website.

Hope you all stick around. Fun times ahead ðŸš€
